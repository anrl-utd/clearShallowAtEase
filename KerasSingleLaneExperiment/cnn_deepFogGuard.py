    # Arguments
        input_shape: optional shape tuple, only to be specified
            if `include_top` is False (otherwise the input shape
            has to be `(224, 224, 3)`
            (with `channels_last` data format)
            or (3, 224, 224) (with `channels_first` data format).
            It should have exactly 3 inputs channels,
            and width and height should be no smaller than 32.
            E.g. `(200, 200, 3)` would be one valid value.
        alpha: controls the width of the network. This is known as the
            width multiplier in the MobileNet paper.
            - If `alpha` < 1.0, proportionally decreases the number
                of filters in each layer.
            - If `alpha` > 1.0, proportionally increases the number
                of filters in each layer.
            - If `alpha` = 1, default number of filters from the paper
                 are used at each layer.
        depth_multiplier: depth multiplier for depthwise convolution. This
            is called the resolution multiplier in the MobileNet paper.
        include_top: whether to include the fully-connected
            layer at the top of the network.
        input_tensor: optional Keras tensor (i.e. output of
            `layers.Input()`)
            to use as image input for the model.
        pooling: Optional pooling mode for feature extraction
            when `include_top` is `False`.
            - `None` means that the output of the model
                will be the 4D tensor output of the
                last convolutional block.
            - `avg` means that global average pooling
                will be applied to the output of the
                last convolutional block, and thus
                the output of the model will be a
                2D tensor.
            - `max` means that global max pooling will
                be applied.
        classes: optional number of classes to classify images
            into

    # Returns
        A Keras model instance.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid argument for `weights`,
            or invalid input shape.
        RuntimeError: If attempting to run this model with a
            backend that does not support separable convolutions.
